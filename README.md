h2 Description

This is a game for android  like  Midas  Miner  for  reference:  
http://www.royalgames.com/games/puzzle-­games/miner-­speed/  

●   The  game  consists  of  a  8x8  grid  with  different  colored  objects  
  
●   The  objects  can  swap  place  as  long  as  they  are  positioned  next  to  each  other  and  on  the  
same  row  or  column  (up,  down,  left,  right)  
  
●   If  a  switch  result  in  three  or  more  object  of  the  same  color  in  a  row  or  column,  these  
objects  are  removed  from  the  game  
  
●   If  a  switch  does  not  result  in  a  match,  the  objects  are  automatically  switched  back  
  
●   When  objects  are  removed  from  the  game,  the  game  board  collapses  so  that  object  
positioned  above  the  removed  ones  falls  down  to  take  their  place  and  new  objects  falls  
in  from  the  top  to  fill  the  board.  

●   The game counts how mach blocks you can remuved during last 15 secunds.
